## Import Structure

The main `app.css` file now imports all these separate files:

```css
@import 'bootstrap';
@import './pages/base.css';
@import './pages/navigation.css';
@import './pages/forms.css';
@import './pages/hero.css';
@import './pages/dashboard-styles.css';
@import './pages/cards.css';
@import './pages/footer.css';
@import './pages/buttons.css';
@import './pages/animations.css';
@import './pages/responsive.css';
```

## Benefits

1. **Better Organization**: Each page group has its own dedicated CSS file
2. **Easier Maintenance**: Changes to specific sections are easier to locate
3. **Improved Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work on different page styles
4. **Cleaner Code**: No more searching through 789 lines of mixed styles
5. **Modular Design**: Individual CSS files can be included/excluded as needed
6. **Better Performance**: Potential for future optimizations and selective loading

## Original File Backup

The original combined CSS file content has been preserved in `app-backup.css` for reference.

## Build Process

Vite will automatically process all imports and combine them into the final CSS bundle during the build process.
