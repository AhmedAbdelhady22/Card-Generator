# User Permission Management System

## Overview
This system provides granular control over user permissions, allowing administrators to grant or deny specific permissions to individual users beyond their role-based permissions.

## Features

### 1. **Individual User Permissions**
- Grant specific permissions to users regardless of their role
- Deny specific permissions to users even if their role has them
- Permissions hierarchy: Denied > Individual > Role

### 2. **Admin Interface**
- View all users and their current permissions
- Visual indicators for role permissions, granted permissions, and denied permissions
- Easy-to-use interface for managing permissions
- Conflict prevention (cannot grant and deny the same permission)

### 3. **Permission-Based Navigation**
- Navigation menu adapts based on user's actual permissions
- Real-time updates when permissions change
- Secure access control throughout the application

## How to Use
